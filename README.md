chrome music lab's [song maker](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/) is immediate and so intuitive, a great tool for anyone approaching music production for the first time, especially kids. it's also very limiting, letting you use one instrument and one pattern at a time.
[most](https://www.ableton.com/en/) [digital](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/) [audio](https://www.bitwig.com/overview/) [workstations](https://ardour.org/) are incredibly powerful and allow you to create almost any sound you can imagine. they're also incredibly complex, hard to learn, resource hungry and (sometimes) expensive.  
my solution:
